<p><strong>Simplex</strong> is a golf-based (i.e. esoteric) programming language that is in its developing stages. It is driven to be somewhat effective at a majority of golfing challenges while retaining its intuitive nature.</p>

<p>Simplex features a right-open memory tape (the term “strip” is also used synonymously), and can be compared to Brain**** in that it allows you to traverse this memory tape. The commands to traverse left and right are <code>L</code> and <code>R</code>, respectively. Traversing to a negative position isn't disallowed, but may/will result in buggy behaviour with other commands.</p>

<p>Simplex features two parsing phases: a pre-proccessing phase and a regular processing phase. In the pre-processing phase, there are two main things going on, besides internal preinitalizations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Single-line comments are removed. That is,  <code>s/(.+?)~~.+$/$1/g</code>. </li>
<li>Compression fields are removed. A compression field is something of the form <code>(.+)(\d+)</code>, that is, (stuff)N, where N is a number. It simply repeats the expression N times. Currently, only linear i.e. non-stacked compression fields are supported. An example would be <code>(RR)5 =&gt; RRRRRRRRRR</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>All other commands (including inline comments <code>!...!</code>) are proccessed during parsing.</p>
